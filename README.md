# BrainfckInterpreterCPP
A Brainf* interpreter implemented in C++11/14 as my first (non)trivial
project in c++

The main purpose of this project was to give me a basic introducting to 
C++. As it stands, I do NOT considered this interpreter completed, as I 
am wanting to add optimizations and self-optimization to the interpreter
so that it can intelligently replace code. 

I am planning on combining this with my Neural Network and my matrix system
to see if I can teach a computer to produce semi-competent code in an 
esoteric language.
